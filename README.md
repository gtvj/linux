# Linux repository

## Purpose and approach

To capture information related to my migration to Linux as my primary OS.

The steps outlined below: 
* use the `/opt/` directory for manual installation of software (i.e. that which is not obtained via Ubuntu Software, Synaptic or `dpkg --install ...` )
* avoid PPAs because:

> Some PPAs are created for development or for beta or even alpha testing. They are not guaranteed to include stable or well-tested software. Anyone is allowed to create a PPA and there is no review procedure, so youâ€™ll also want to install only PPAs from sources you trust. Use at your own risk.
